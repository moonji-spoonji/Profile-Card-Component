## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I want to work more with background design. I am not too familiar with how to incorporate images, or more specifically .svg files, with a background or simple positioning for more elegant designs.
